                            Hello! I am a passionate computer science student with a keen interest in programming.
                            I love solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.
                            I am currently pursuing a Computer Science Comprehensive major at the University of Nebraska at Kearney.

                                Hello! My name is Christian Thede. Currently I am a sophomore at the University of Nebraska at Kearney
                                but that is not where I started. I grew up in a small town in Nebraska called Palmer. My family has a
                                farm there and I grew up helping out around the farm. Around freshman year of high school I transferred to
                                St. Paul where I graduated. Throughout my time in high school I started to become more interested in
                                computers and technology. I began looking into how technology can help around the family farm and even
                                started using drones to help with issues there. I even started using them to create 3d maps
                                through photogrammetry. Then, I decided to build myself a computer. I threw myself into research.
                                I learned about all the different parts and how they work together. I looked into what parts would
                                work the best and would last. Then, I finally built my computer and that was what really started me off
                                on my computer science journey. I began attending the University of Nebraska at Kearney where I took 
                                my first programming class - Python for Analytics. I loved it and the problems I was able to solve.

                        <p>Throughout my time of working to strenghthen my computer and coding skills I have completed a
                            couple projects. I use these projects both as an opportunity to test and expand my skills and as a way to
                            showcase my abilities. This website is one such project. I have coded it from the ground up, starting when
                            I didn't know anything about CSS or JavaScript and was checking out outdated HTML books from the library to
                            learn anything I could. I have learned a lot since then and I am excited to continue to grow as I learn more.

                        <p>
                            This website is a project I have been working on for a while. Through working on this website I have learned 
                            not only about the code behind a website but have also put a lot of time into the design and layout. I have
                            learned a lot about GitHub and web hosting opportunities. I have also learned a bit about git in general.
                            I have gone through many iterations of this website and have had instances where I have put in long hours of coding
                            just to throw it all away and start over from scratch. Additionally, I have started gaining experience in how
                            to use CSS to style a website made for desktop to also work on mobile.
                            This is a project that I am proud of and I am excited to continue to work on it and improve it more.
